# SpaceNet_ParticleFilter
Particle Filter code for  CU Boulder SpaceNet Senior Project.
Inputs position data for a satellite flying by four ground based RF sensors and Time delay of Arrival for each sensor relative to the others.
This code is based on the idea outlined [this paper](https://ssdl.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/ssdl-files/papers/conferencePapers/AAS-15-738.pdf) by Johnny L. Worthy III and Marcus Holzinger.
- Main PF_OrbitIn3D.m
- Run out of the box
- change sat and ind1 to pick which satellite to predict and which flyby to select.
- change DoPlot to 1 to plot the particles and satelite in 3D.
